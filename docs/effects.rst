Effects
=======

Add animated visual effects to any dock. Effects overlay the dock without affecting interaction.

Open the management window → **Properties** → **Effects** to access these settings.

Snow
----

Gentle falling snowflakes for a winter theme.

Toggle **Snow** on to enable. Snowflakes fall using a three-layer depth effect (near, middle, far) for a realistic look. The effect is GPU-accelerated, so performance impact is minimal.

Vertical docks automatically adjust the particle behavior — snowflakes fall with a wider spread and longer lifetime to fill the taller shape.

Fireworks
---------

Colorful bursting fireworks for a celebratory theme.

Toggle **Fireworks** on to enable. Rockets launch from random positions along the dock, trail sparks, then burst into a multi-color explosion. The palette cycles through seven colors: red, green, blue, gold, pink, purple, and white.

Like snow, vertical docks adjust the launch direction so fireworks fire perpendicular to the dock.

Combining effects
-----------------

Both effects can be enabled simultaneously on the same dock. Each dock has independent effect settings.
