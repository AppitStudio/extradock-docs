Shelf
=====

The Shelf widget is a temporary file storage area built into your dock. Drag files in, store them temporarily, and drag them out to another destination — similar to apps like Yoink or Dropover.

Adding files
------------

Drag files from Finder onto the Shelf widget icon. Files are copied into the shelf's storage area.

Viewing and managing files
--------------------------

Click the Shelf widget to open a panel showing all stored files. From the panel you can:

- **Drag out** — Drag files from the panel to any destination
- **Preview** — See file names and icons
- **Remove** — Delete files from the shelf

Files persist across app restarts until you remove them.
