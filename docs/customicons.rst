Custom Icons
============

Replace any app or folder icon with a custom one. Custom icons are stored in a local library so you can reuse them across docks.

Changing an icon
----------------

1. Right-click an item in the dock → **Change Icon**

2. The icon picker opens with three tabs:

   - **Library** — Icons you've already imported
   - **URL** — Download an icon from a URL
   - **File** — Upload from a local file

3. Select or import an icon → **Apply**

To go back to the original icon, right-click the item → **Revert to Original Icon**.

Supported formats
-----------------

- **PNG** (recommended — supports transparency)
- **JPEG**
- **ICNS** (macOS icon files)

High-resolution icons (512x512 or larger) work best. Icons are automatically resized for the dock.

Icon library
------------

All imported icons are saved to your library at ``~/Library/Application Support/ExtraDock/icons/``. You can manage the full library from **Settings** (⚙) → **Icon Library**:

- **Search** icons by name
- **Delete** icons you no longer need

Icons associated with a specific app appear first when you open the picker for that app.

Tips
----

- PNG with transparency gives the cleanest look
- Try `macosicons.com <https://macosicons.com>`_ for free icon packs
