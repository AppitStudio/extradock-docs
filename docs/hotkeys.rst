Hotkeys
=======

Assign a global keyboard shortcut to any dock. Press the hotkey from anywhere to show or hide that dock instantly.

Setting up a hotkey
-------------------

1. Open the management window → select a dock → **Properties** → **Shortcuts**

2. Enable **Enable Hotkey**

3. Click the shortcut recorder and press your desired key combination

The shortcut is now active system-wide. Press it once to show the dock, press again to hide it.

Auto-hide after hotkey
----------------------

When you show a dock via its hotkey, it can automatically hide again after a delay. Choose from:

- **Never** — Dock stays visible until you press the hotkey again or interact elsewhere
- **3 seconds**
- **5 seconds**
- **10 seconds**

This is useful for quick-glance workflows — press the hotkey, launch an app, and the dock disappears on its own.

Tips
----

- Each dock can have its own unique hotkey
- Disabling the hotkey toggle clears the recorded shortcut
- Hotkeys work regardless of which app is in the foreground
- Combine with auto-hide for a keyboard-driven dock that stays out of the way
