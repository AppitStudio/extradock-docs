Stripe
======

The Stripe widget displays revenue data from your Stripe account directly in your dock. Designed for developers and business owners who want a quick glance at their numbers.

Setup
-----

1. Open ExtraDock → **Settings** (⚙) → **Integrations**

2. Enter your Stripe API key

3. Add a Stripe widget to any dock

The widget caches data locally and fetches only what's missing, keeping API usage minimal.
