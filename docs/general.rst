General Settings
================

Core app behavior and system integration options.

Open **Settings** (⚙) → **General** to access these settings.

Launch at startup
-----------------

Toggle **Launch at startup** to automatically start ExtraDock when you log in to your Mac.

Requires macOS 13 or later.

App Mode
--------

Choose how ExtraDock appears in your system:

- **Menu Bar Only** — ExtraDock lives in the menu bar with no Dock icon
- **Dock App Only** — ExtraDock appears as a regular app in the macOS Dock
- **Menu Bar + Dock Icon** — Both (default)

Hide native macOS Dock
----------------------

Toggle **Hide native macOS Dock** to suppress the built-in Apple Dock while ExtraDock is running. ExtraDock applies a deep auto-hide setting to the native Dock process. Turn this off anytime to restore your previous Dock behavior.

Show management window on launch
---------------------------------

Toggle **Show management window on launch** to automatically open the management window every time ExtraDock starts. Useful during initial setup; you can disable it once your docks are configured.
