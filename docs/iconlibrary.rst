Icon Library
============

Manage all the custom icons you've imported into ExtraDock.

Open **Settings** (⚙) → **Icon Library** to access the library.

Overview
--------

Every icon you import — whether from a file, URL, or the icon picker — is saved to your local library at ``~/Library/Application Support/ExtraDock/icons/``. The library view lets you browse, search, and clean up your collection in one place.

Searching
---------

Use the search field at the top to filter icons by name. This is helpful once your library grows large.

Deleting icons
--------------

Select an icon and delete it to remove it from the library. Removing an icon from the library does not revert any dock items currently using that icon — they keep their assigned icon until you change it.

See :doc:`customicons` for details on importing and applying custom icons.
