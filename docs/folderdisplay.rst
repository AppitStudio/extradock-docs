Folder Display Names
====================

Show a folder's name below its icon for quick identification.

Enabling it
-----------

1. Open the management window → select a dock → **Items** tab

2. Click the gear icon on a folder item

3. Enable **Always Display Name** in the Icon Display section

When enabled, the folder icon shrinks to 70% size and the folder name appears below it, truncated to about 10 characters. Everything fits within the standard icon frame.
