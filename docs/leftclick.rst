Left-Click Behavior
===================

Choose what happens when you left-click a running app's icon in a dock.

Open **Settings** (⚙) → **General** → **Left Click Behavior** to access this setting.

Normal
------

The default behavior. Clicking an app icon opens or activates the app — the same as clicking an icon in the macOS Dock.

Toggle Minimize
---------------

Clicking the icon of the currently active app minimizes all its windows. Clicking it again restores them. This matches the behavior some users expect from Windows taskbars.

**Requires Accessibility permission.** macOS needs permission for ExtraDock to control other app windows. You'll be prompted to grant access in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility.

Without the permission, clicks fall back to normal open/activate behavior.
