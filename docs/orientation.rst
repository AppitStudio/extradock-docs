Orientation
===========

Each dock can be laid out horizontally or vertically, independent of other docks.

Switching orientation
---------------------

- **Right-click** the dock → **Orientation** → **Horizontal** or **Vertical**
- **Management window** → **Properties** → **Position** → **Orientation**

Horizontal
----------

Icons are arranged left to right. This is the default for new docks and works well along the top or bottom of a screen.

Vertical
--------

Icons are arranged top to bottom. Works well pinned to the left or right edge of a screen, or as a sidebar-style launcher.

All features — collapse, auto-hide, widgets, effects — adapt automatically to the dock's orientation.
