TamaDocky
=========

TamaDocky is a virtual pet cat that lives in your dock. Take care of it and watch it react with different animations.

Features
--------

- **6 animations** — Idle, Idle2, LayDown, Sleepy, Waiting, Surprised
- **8 pet skins** — Choose a look for your cat
- **15 room backgrounds** — Set the scene behind your pet
- **Pet stats** — Happiness, hunger, and energy levels change over time

Interacting
-----------

Click or hover over TamaDocky to see different reactions. The pet's stats affect which animations play — a happy, well-fed cat behaves differently from a hungry, tired one.

Customization
-------------

Open the widget settings to choose your pet's skin and room background.
