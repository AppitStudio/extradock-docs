Creating & Managing Docks
=========================

Every dock in ExtraDock is fully independent — its own apps, appearance, position, and behavior settings.

Creating a dock
---------------

There are two ways to create a new dock:

- **Menu bar** — Click the ExtraDock icon → **New Dock**
- **Management window** — Click **+ New Dock** in the dock list

New docks appear as floating horizontal docks on your current screen with default settings.

Renaming a dock
---------------

Give docks meaningful names to keep track of them:

- **Right-click** the dock background → **Rename**
- **Management window** — Double-click the dock name in the list

Use names that match your workflow: "Dev", "Design", "Chat", "Utilities".

Duplicating a dock
------------------

Right-click the dock background → **Duplicate**, or use the **Duplicate** button in the management window's Properties tab. This creates a copy with all the same apps and settings.

Copy & paste settings
---------------------

Apply one dock's settings to another:

1. Right-click the source dock → **Copy Settings**

2. Right-click the target dock → **Paste Settings**

This copies appearance, behavior, and position settings — not the apps inside.

Removing a dock
---------------

Right-click the dock background → **Show Management Screen**, then use the **Remove Dock** button in the Properties tab. You'll be asked to confirm.

You can also hide a dock without removing it — right-click → **Hide This Dock**. Hidden docks can be shown again from the menu bar.
