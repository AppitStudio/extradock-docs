Fullscreen Detection
====================

ExtraDock detects when an app enters fullscreen and automatically hides docks on that screen.

How it works
------------

When a fullscreen app is active on a display, docks assigned to that display hide automatically. Docks on other screens are unaffected. When you exit fullscreen, the docks reappear.

Detection is per-screen — only the dock on the same screen as the fullscreen app hides.

Enabling and disabling
----------------------

Fullscreen hiding is **on by default** for all docks.

To disable it for a specific dock:

- **Right-click** the dock → **Don't Hide on Fullscreen**
- **Management window** → **Properties** → **Behavior** → **Hide on Fullscreen**
