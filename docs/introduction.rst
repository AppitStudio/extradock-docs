What is ExtraDock?
------------------

ExtraDock is a macOS app that lets you create multiple floating docks and place them anywhere on any screen. Each dock has its own apps, settings, and behavior — so you can organize your workspace exactly how you want.

macOS gives you a single Dock. ExtraDock gives you as many as you need.

Who is it for?
--------------

- **Multi-monitor users** — Dedicated docks per screen, each with the apps you use on that display.
- **Developers** — A coding dock on one monitor, a chat dock on another, a utilities dock somewhere else.
- **Designers** — Group design tools separately from communication and reference apps.
- **Power users** — Anyone who finds the single macOS Dock limiting.

How is it different from Dock replacements?
-------------------------------------------

ExtraDock is not a Dock replacement. It works **alongside** the native macOS Dock — your system Dock stays exactly where it is.

Other tools try to replace or heavily modify the Dock. ExtraDock just adds more docks wherever you want them.

--------------

- **Multiple docks** — Create as many as you need, each fully independent
- **Multi-screen** — Assign docks to specific displays, auto-hide on disconnect
- **Lightweight** — Minimal CPU and memory usage
- **Customizable** — Per-dock colors, sizes, orientation, and behavior
- **Works offline** — Internet needed only for license activation
- **Private** — No analytics, no telemetry, your config stays local
