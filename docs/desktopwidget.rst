Desktop Widget Mode
===================

Desktop Widget mode keeps a dock behind all app windows, so it acts like part of your desktop wallpaper.

How it works
------------

When enabled, the dock sits at the desktop level. App windows always appear in front of it. You can see the dock when you show your desktop or when no windows overlap its position.

This is useful for docks you want visible as ambient information (like a clock widget dock or a status dock) without interfering with your window layout.

Enabling it
-----------

**Management window** → **Properties** → **Behavior** → **Act as Desktop Widget**

When Desktop Widget mode is on, auto-hide and fullscreen hiding still work as configured.
