Auto-Hide
=========

Auto-hide makes a dock disappear when you're not using it and reappear when you move your mouse to its location.

Enabling auto-hide
------------------

- **Right-click** the dock → **Enable Auto-hide**
- **Management window** → **Properties** → **Behavior** → **Auto-hide**

Each dock has its own auto-hide setting — some docks can auto-hide while others stay visible.

Delay
-----

Control how long the dock waits before hiding after your mouse leaves:

- **Instant** — 0.2 seconds
- **Quick** — 0.5 seconds
- **Normal** — 1.0 second (default)
- **Custom** — Slide to any value between 0.1 and 5 seconds

**Right-click** the dock → **Auto-hide Delay** for quick presets, or use the management window for the full slider.

How it works
------------

1. Your mouse leaves the dock area
2. The hide timer starts (based on your delay setting)
3. If you move back to the dock before the timer ends, the timer cancels
4. If the timer completes, the dock slides off screen
5. Move your mouse to where the dock was and it slides back
