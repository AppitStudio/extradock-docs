Respect Dock Space
==================

When a fixed dock is on a screen edge, Respect Dock Space prevents app windows from overlapping it when they expand.

How it works
------------

When you zoom (green button) or double-click a window's title bar to expand it, macOS normally fills the entire screen. With Respect Dock Space enabled, ExtraDock detects the overlap and resizes the window to fit the available area — leaving room for your fixed dock.

This only applies to fixed mode docks.

Enabling it
-----------

**Management window** → **Properties** → **Behavior** → **Respect Dock Space**

Or globally for all fixed docks:

Open ExtraDock → **Settings** (⚙) → **General** → **Dock Behavior** → **Respect Dock Space**

Active on drag
--------------

By default, windows are only corrected on expand-style resizes (zoom, double-click). Enable **Active on Drag** to also correct windows after manual drag or resize operations.

Open ExtraDock → **Settings** (⚙) → **General** → **Dock Behavior** → **Active on Drag**

Accessibility permission
------------------------

This feature requires macOS Accessibility permission to detect and reposition other app windows.

**System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility** → add ExtraDock.

ExtraDock will prompt you to grant permission when you enable the feature.
