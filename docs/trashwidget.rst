Trash

The Trash widget adds a trash can to your dock. It supports two modes.

Modes
-----

- **Native macOS Trash** — Works with the system trash. Drag files onto it to move them to the macOS Trash.
- **Virtual Trash** — ExtraDock's own trash with a built-in file browser for managing trashed items.
