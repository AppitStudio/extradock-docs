Snap to Edges
=============

When you drag a floating dock near a screen edge, it snaps into position automatically.

How it works
------------

As you drag a dock close to any edge of the screen, it gently snaps to align with that edge. This makes it easy to place docks precisely without manual pixel-level positioning.

Disabling snapping
------------------

If you prefer full manual control over dock placement:

Open ExtraDock → **Settings** (⚙) → **General** → **Dock Behavior** → enable **Disable magnetic snapping when near the edge of the screen**.

When disabled, docks no longer snap and can be placed at any position freely.
