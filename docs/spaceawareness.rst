Space Awareness
===============

The Space Awareness widget shows apps that have windows in the current macOS Space (virtual desktop). As you switch between Spaces, the widget updates to reflect which apps are active in each one.

This gives you a quick visual indicator of what's running in your current workspace without checking Mission Control.
