Floating Mode
=============

Floating mode lets you place a dock anywhere on screen by dragging it freely.

How it works
------------

In floating mode, a dock is an independent window you can drag to any position. It stays where you put it and remembers its position across restarts.

Setting up
----------

Floating is the default mode for new docks. To switch an existing dock to floating:

- **Right-click** the dock → **Position Mode** → **Floating**
- **Management window** → **Properties** → **Position** → **Mode** → **Floating**

Dragging
--------

Click and drag the dock background to reposition it. On hover, a drag handle appears at the edge of the dock.

To always show the drag handle:

- **Right-click** the dock → **Show Drag Icon**
- **Management window** → **Properties** → **Behavior** → **Show Drag Handle**

Position lock
-------------

Lock a dock's position to prevent accidental movement:

- **Right-click** the dock → **Lock Position**

When locked, the dock cannot be moved by dragging. Unlock it the same way.
