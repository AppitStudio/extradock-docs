Drag & Drop onto Items
======================

You can drag files from Finder onto dock items to perform actions — similar to the native macOS Dock.

Open with app
-------------

Drag a file onto an application icon in the dock. The file opens with that application.

For example, drag an image onto Photoshop to open it there, or drag a ``.txt`` file onto VS Code.

The app icon scales up slightly and shows a blue border to indicate it's a valid drop target.

Move to folder
--------------

Drag a file or folder onto a folder icon in the dock. The item is moved into that folder.

The folder icon scales up and shows a green border during the drag.

If a file with the same name already exists, you'll be asked to **Replace**, **Keep Both**, or **Cancel**.
