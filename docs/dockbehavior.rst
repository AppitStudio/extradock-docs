Dock Behavior
=============

Global settings that affect how all docks interact with the screen and other windows.

Open **Settings** (⚙) → **General** → **Dock Behavior** to access these settings.

Magnetic snapping
-----------------

When dragging a floating dock near a screen edge, it magnetically snaps into alignment. Toggle **Disable magnetic snapping when near the edge of the screen** to turn this off if you prefer full free-form positioning.

Respect Dock Space
------------------

When enabled, expanded (maximized) app windows stay outside the area occupied by your fixed docks. This prevents windows from hiding behind edge-pinned docks.

**Requires Accessibility permission.** ExtraDock uses macOS Accessibility to detect and resize overlapping windows.

Active on Drag
--------------

By default, Respect Dock Space only adjusts windows when they are expanded (zoom or double-click the title bar). Enable **Active on Drag** to also adjust windows after a manual drag or resize that overlaps a fixed dock.

This sub-option is only available when Respect Dock Space is enabled.
