============

Requirements
------------

- macOS 12.4 (Monterey) or later
- Works on Intel and Apple Silicon Macs

Download
--------

Get ExtraDock from `extradock.app <https://extradock.app>`_.

Setup
-----

1. Open the downloaded ``.dmg`` file

2. Drag ExtraDock to your Applications folder

3. Open ExtraDock from Applications

4. Enter your license key when prompted

That's it. ExtraDock appears in your menu bar and you're ready to create docks.

License Activation
------------------

Your license is tied to your device. A one-time internet connection is required for activation. After that, ExtraDock validates locally with a server check every 7 days and a local fallback if you're offline.

Uninstall
---------

Drag ExtraDock from Applications to Trash. Configuration is stored in ``~/Library/Application Support/ExtraDock/`` if you want to clean that up too.
