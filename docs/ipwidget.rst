IP Address
==========

The IP Address widget displays your public IP address in the dock. It refreshes periodically and supports both horizontal and vertical dock layouts.

How it works
------------

The widget fetches your public IP address from an external service and displays it directly in the dock. It refreshes automatically at a configurable interval.
