Notification Settings
====================

Control how notification badges appear on dock icons.

Open **Settings** (⚙) → **Notifications** to access these settings.

Enabling badges
---------------

1. Click **Enable Notification Badges**

2. A dialog explains how the feature works — confirm to opt in

3. Grant **Accessibility permission** when prompted (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility)

Once enabled, apps that display badge counts in the macOS Dock will also show those counts on their icons in ExtraDock.

Global toggle
-------------

**Show Notification Badges** turns badge display on or off across all docks at once.

Show Full Number
----------------

By default, counts above 99 are displayed as **99+**. Enable **Show Full Number** to display the exact count instead.

Per-app overrides
-----------------

The **Per-App Settings** list shows all currently running apps. Toggle any app off to hide its badge count while keeping badges visible for everything else.

Click **Refresh App List** to update the list if you've launched or quit apps since opening the settings.

.. note::

   Notification badges require Accessibility permission. Without it, badge counts cannot be read from running applications.
