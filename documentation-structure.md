## Notes

- **Notification Badges** are WIP — document what's there, note it may change
- **Stripe widget** and **Integrations** page are niche/developer-facing — keep them short
- **Dock Name Display** is hidden/disabled — skip it
- Each widget gets its own page since they're each a distinct feature with their own settings
- Some smaller pages (Snow Effect, Fireworks Effect) could be merged into a single "Effects" page — your call
- Respect Dock Space could fold into Fixed Mode — your call
